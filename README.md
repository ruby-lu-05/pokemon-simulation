# Python Pokemon Battle Simulation

A simple text-based game that simulates a pokemon battle.

Summary:
* The user starts by choosing a pokemon (Wailord, Ninetails, or Jolteon)
* The computer sends out a random pokemon (Kingler, Flareon, or Raichu)
* Each pokemon has certain characteristics, including type (fire/water/electric) and HP
* For the player's turn, they can choose to either switch pokemon, fight, or stop the game. The computer has the same options
* If the user chooses to fight, they can pick a move (each pokemon has unique moves)
* There is an HP bar that updates based on how much damage was done. Certain moves will be more effective (e.g water moves are more effective for fire pokemon)
* The program will tell the user whether their move was effective
* Sometimes, the user's or computer's move can randomly miss and cause 0 damage
* The user and computer can also choose to switch to any pokemon that still has HP
* The game keeps going until one player loses all their HP
